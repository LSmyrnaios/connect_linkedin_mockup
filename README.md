### How to Run
* First you need to install the Frontend node-modules<br/>
```
npm install
npm install @angular/cli@1.7.4
npm install --save jwt-decode
```
* Then to run the app you have to open two terminals, one for each end (Back & Front).<br/>
In the first terminal, run the Backend by executing the following command:<br/>
```
./gradlew bootrun
```

In the second terminal, run the Frontend by executing the following commands:<br/>
```
cd frontend
ng serve --open --ssl
```

* Finally a browser window will open on **https://localhost:4200**<br/>
